OBJECTIVES: To determine variation in outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients among intensivists, as well as associations between intensivist experience and patient outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated Medicare fee-for-service patients in acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania using administrative, clinical, and physician data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the American Medical Association from 2008 and 2009. We identified intensivists by training background, board certification, and claims for services provided to patients admitted to an intensive care unit. We assigned patients to intensivists for outcome attribution based on submitted claims for critical care and in-patient services. We estimated the physician-specific adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day mortality using a hierarchical model with a random effect for physician, adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. We tested for independent association of physician experience with patient outcomes using mixed-effects regression for the primary outcome of 30-day mortality. We defined physician experience in two ways: years since training completion ("duration") and annual number of mechanically ventilated patients ("volume").
RESULTS: We assigned 345 physicians to 11,268 patients. The 30-day mortality was 43\% and median hospital length of stay was 11 days (interquartile range = 6-18). The physician adjusted OR varied from 0.72 to 1.64 (median = 0.99; interquartile range = 0.92-1.09). A total of 48\% of physicians was outliers, with an adjusted OR significantly different from 1. However, among intensivists, physician experience was not associated with 30-day mortality (duration OR = 1.00 per additional year; 95\% confidence interval = 1.00-1.01; volume OR = 1.00 per additional patient; 95\% confidence interval = 1.00-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Intensivists independently contribute to outcomes of Medicare patients who undergo mechanical ventilation, as evidenced by the variation in risk-adjusted mortality across intensivists. However, physician experience does not underlie this relationship between intensivists, suggesting the need to identify modifiable physician factors to improve outcomes.},

 abstract = {RATIONALE

Severe sepsis is increasing in incidence and has a high rate of inpatient mortality. Hospitals that treat a larger number of patients with severe sepsis may offer a survival advantage.

OBJECTIVES

We sought to assess the effect of severe sepsis case volume on mortality, hypothesizing that higher volume centers would have lower rates of inpatient death.

METHODS

We performed a retrospective cohort study over a 7-year period (2004-2010), using a nationally representative sample of hospital admissions, examining the relation between volume, urban location, organ dysfunction, and survival.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS

To identify potential differences in outcomes, hospitals were divided into five categories ({\textless}50, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, and 500+ annual cases) and adjusted mortality was compared by volume. A total of 914,200 patients with severe sepsis were identified over a 7-year period (2004-2010). Overall in-hospital mortality was 28.1{\%}. In a fully adjusted model, there was an inverse relationship between severe sepsis case volume and inpatient mortality. Hospitals in the highest volume category had substantially improved survival compared with hospitals with the lowest case volume (adjusted odds ratio, 0.64; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.60-0.69). In cases of severe sepsis with one reported organ dysfunction, a mortality of 18.9{\%} was found in hospitals with fewer than 50 annual cases compared with 10.4{\%} in hospitals treating 500+ cases (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.49-0.59). Similar differences were found in patients with up to three total organ dysfunctions.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with severe sepsis treated in hospitals with higher case volumes had improved adjusted outcomes.},

@article{Merchant__2014__Hospitalvariationin,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is common and often fatal. However, the extent to which hospitals vary in survival outcomes and the degree to which this variation is explained by patient and hospital factors is unknown.

METHODS AND RESULTS

Within Get with the Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 135 896 index IHCA events at 468 hospitals. Using hierarchical models, we adjusted for demographics comorbidities and arrest characteristics (eg, initial rhythm, etiology, arrest location) to generate risk-adjusted rates of in-hospital survival. To quantify the extent of hospital-level variation in risk-adjusted rates, we calculated the median odds ratio (OR). Among study hospitals, there was significant variation in unadjusted survival rates. The median unadjusted rate for the bottom decile was 8.3{\%} (range: 0{\%} to 10.7{\%}) and for the top decile was 31.4{\%} (28.6{\%} to 51.7{\%}). After adjusting for 36 predictors of in-hospital survival, there remained substantial variation in rates of in-hospital survival across sites: bottom decile (median rate, 12.4{\%} [0{\%} to 15.6{\%}]) versus top decile (median rate, 22.7{\%} [21.0{\%} to 36.2{\%}]). The median OR for risk-adjusted survival was 1.42 (95{\%} CI: 1.37 to 1.46), which suggests a substantial 42{\%} difference in the odds of survival for patients with similar case-mix at similar hospitals. Further, significant variation persisted within hospital subgroups (eg, bed size, academic).

CONCLUSION

Significant variability in IHCA survival exists across hospitals, and this variation persists despite adjustment for measured patient factors and within hospital subgroups. These findings suggest that other hospital factors may account for the observed site-level variations in IHCA survival.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

An increased volume of patients is associated with improved survival in numerous high-risk medical and surgical conditions. The relationship between the number of patients admitted (hospital volume) and outcome among patients with critical illnesses is unknown.

METHODS

We analyzed data from 20,241 nonsurgical patients receiving mechanical ventilation at 37 acute care hospitals in the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation clinical information system from 2002 through 2003. Multivariate analyses were performed to adjust for the severity of illness and other differences in the case mix.

RESULTS

An increase in hospital volume was associated with improved survival among patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital. Admission to a hospital in the highest quartile according to volume (i.e., {\textgreater}400 patients receiving mechanical ventilation per year) was associated with a 37 percent reduction in the adjusted odds of death in the ICU as compared with admission to hospitals in the lowest quartile ({\textless} or =150 patients receiving mechanical ventilation per year, P{\textless}0.001). In-hospital mortality was similarly reduced (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.83; P{\textless}0.001). A typical patient in a hospital in a low-volume quartile would have an adjusted in-hospital mortality of 34.2 percent as compared with 25.5 percent in a hospital in a high-volume quartile. Among survivors, there were no significant trends in the length of stay in the ICU or the hospital.

CONCLUSIONS

Mechanical ventilation of patients in a hospital with a high case volume is associated with reduced mortality. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism of the relationship between volume and outcome among patients with a critical illness.},
